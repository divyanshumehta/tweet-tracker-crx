# Tweet Tracker Chrome Extension

This is a chrome extension that tracks and shoots notifications when a followed twitter handle tweets a message. The tweets are tracks under three categories **Text**, **Photo**, **Text and Photo**.

## Directions for use
1. After installing the extension, head over to the options page and enter the twitter handles you want to track.
2. On the options page itself the user can choose between the three categories of tweet in which she/he likes to be notified
3. In order to see the tweets of the tracked handles the user can select the tweet category from the browser action icon of the app. Then click on "Get Tweets" button the user will be take to the page where she/he can see the tweets of the handles since the user has started to track the handles.

## Points to Improve
1. Current the polling for new tweets and notifications take once every 5mins. This is less owing to the free plan on Heroku.
2. The UI of the extesion, option page and tweets pages need to be improved. PS. I love super-mininal UI to keep it fast :stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes:
